## Intro

- This website is designed to be used from a mobile phone, tablet or PC by:
  - Customers as 'clients' in order to view the menu and order
  - Staff as 'admins' (implicit default as no auth is implemented) in order to make modifications (ex: change menu availability)

### Notes

- All core tasks completed. Bonus: Responsive layout, Modal view, Search and Sort
- Fully responsive on all devices, supporting screen sizes as low as 300px
- Product details displayed dynamically as drawers for mobiles and tablets vs modals for desktops
- localStorage is used to simulate persistent data storage upon page refresh (ex: cart items) and updates (ex: availability toggling)
- Locally managed state with useContext being used to avoid prop drilling
- Custom hooks implemented:
  - useCart hook created to handle local state management for cart
  - useMenuData hook created to manage menu products data, as the single source of truth for the latest updated info (ex: availability)
  - useAvailabilityToggle hook created to handle availability toggling

### Further to dos / improvements

- Buttons directly on product cards for interacting with the cart.
- Reduce rerenders.
- Add component unit tests, fix linting errors.
